Competition: OFC Champions Cup
Season: 2008-2009
BlockSource: http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oceacup09.html

* Was to be contested between champions of Papua New Guinea, the Cook Islands and Tuvalu; as the representatives of the Cook Islands (Tupapa) and Tuvalu (Nauti FC) withdrew, Hekari United (Papua New Guinea) automatically gained entry; it is not known why the Tahitian champions (AS Manu Ura) and the New Caledonian champions (AS Magenta) were not allowed to enter the qualifying tournament.

* The 2009/10 edition will see an increase to eight clubs, with New Caledonia and Tahiti gaining an automatic entrant (both in the group featuring two clubs from New Zealand as well); OFC member countries wishing to enter a club will apparently need to have a 'national' league with at least eight 'franchises' participating (the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu currently do not meet this condition).
