Competition: AFC Cup 
Season: 2004

*NB: competition for so-called 'developing' countries, as per the
*    the 'Vision Asia' paper of AFC President Mohamed Bin Hammam.  
*    These are excluded from the Champions League.

*The 14 eligible countries are:
*    Central and West Asia (6): Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Syria,
*                               Turkmenistan, Yemen
*    East Asia (8): Bangladesh, Hongkong, India, Malaysia, Maldives,
*                   Myanmar, North Korea, Singapore

*Of these, Jordan, Myanmar and North Korea decided not to enter any
*teams at all, while Hongkong and Oman both allocated only one of 
*their two slots, meaning only 20 teams enter instead of 28.  Of these
*20, two more (one each from Bangladesh and Yemen) withdrew before the
*start of the competition, reducing participation to 18 teams.

*Excluded Countries (Presidents Cup 2005)

*The following 17 AFC members were denied participation of their clubs
*in the Champions League and AFC Cup, apparently on the grounds of not 
*being considered either 'mature' or 'developing' in the so-called 
*'Vision Asia' paper:

*Afghanistan, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Guam, Kyrgyzstan, 
*Laos, Macao, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, 
*Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Tajikistan.

*These 'emerging' nations will be invited to enter their national 
*team in the bi-annual AFC Challenge Cup starting in 2006. 

*In addition, the 'AFC Presidents Cup' for club teams from these
*countries will start in May 2005.  An initial list of participating
*countries publised in October 2004 in Nepal (whose representatives
*are to be Three Star Club) omitted Brunei and Tajikistan (though 
*both countries have a well-functioning league).
