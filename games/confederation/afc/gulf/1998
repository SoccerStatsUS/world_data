Never-Say-Die Kuwait claims its  9th "Gulf Cup" trophy.


     Kuwait succeeded in retaining the "Gulf Cup" after a close challenge with
hot-favourites  Saudi Arabia, setting a new record for this competition, as 
illustrious winners on 9 occasions.

     At the end of the day, the final outcome of this competition was left till
the very last kick of this 13-day round-robin tournament. This being said, it 
should be mentioned that the hectic schedule which featured every side confronting
the other 5 competitors in such a very short spell of time, brought the overall
performances of the 6 nations down to the lowest levels.

     Only Kuwait emerged as the most consistent, committed and convincing side,
staging a remarkable comeback after an early narrow defeat by the Saudis, which
saw them recording 4 consecutive emphatic wins over their opponents in a very 
thrilling fashion. This is why all the regional football observers were stunned
at the aftermath of the competition to hear the announcement of their Czech 
manager, Mr. Milan Macala, in which he stated his willingness to quit the Gulf
region and rejoin his family back in Prague, following a rather very successful 
record with Kuwait (leading the national team to both  latest 1996 & 1998 Gulf
Cup coveted trophies). 

     As for other failing national coaches, the German Otto Pfister was sacked
by Saudi Arabia, and the current rumours affirm that the Saudi FA is currently
in advanced talks with World Cup winning manager, Frenchman Aimé Jacquet, in 
order to appoint him as manager of their side. 

     Concerning Qatar, who ended the competition at the bottom spot (for the 
very first time  in this 27-year old competition!), reports quoted today that 
Mr. Berti Vogts who resigned last month from the managerial spot at the German
national team arrived yesterday to Doha city, in order to negociate a probable
3-year contract with local national side. The bitter failure of the competition, 
without any doubt, was the United Arab Emirates, who ended their rather dismal
campaign with a (1-4) humiliating defeat at the hands of the ultimate winners
Kuwait, drawing the attention at the current situation of the newly-signed 
Portuguese manager, Mr. Carlos Manuel Queiroz, particularly following last 
month's bitter displays in the 7th ARAB CUP.

     But all credit to  Kuwait's marvellous achievement goes, primarily, to the
Kuwait FA, who kept faith with the Czech Milan Macala for 4 consecutive years 
(a very lengthy period by the Arab National Federations' own standards!), despite 
his failure to guide his side to the last World Cup finals, a period which 
allowed him to build a team full of charisma and flair, with great character 
and individual skilful players, added to a never ending toll of strength-in-depth 
rising stars, eager to show their abilities at least at the regional level of 
Asian soccer.

     Kuwait's campaign in this 14th edition of the GULF CUP was simply magnificent: 
in their inaugural match, 2 rare blunders committed by 1st-team choice goalkeeper 
Khaled Al-Fadli allowed the Saudi star forward Obaid Al-Dossari to grab two goals 
for his side, and claim a narrow (2-1) win over Kuwait. But the final scoreline
didn't reflect at all the overall supremacy of the Kuwaiti footballers throughout 
the 90 minutes.

     Mr. Macala decided to oust Al-Fadli from the starting line-up in the 
following fixture (a crucial and tricky encounter versus unpredictable side, 
Qatar) and substitute Ahmed Jassem came to the rescue, conceding only 3 goals 
in the remaining 4 matches of the competition: Kuwait thrashed Qatar (6-2) in 
the second encounter, disposed of hosts Bahrain (2-0) afterwards, before 
annihilating Oman (5-0) and outclassing the UAE (4-1) in the final fixture.

     The side provided the football fans with an extremely thrilling football 
playing scheme, which saw them netting no less than 18 goals in only 5 matches,
and claiming virtually all the competition's prizes: Champions of the competition, 
the Best Striker spot with the prolific Jassem Al-Howidi's exciting 8 goals tally 
(without any penalty), the Most Valuable Player's prize with the attacking 
midfielder Badr Hajji claiming it (he also clinched this  same prize during 
last month's 7th ARAB CUP !), and finally  the Fair-Play team award, leaving 
only the Best Keeper's prize to the Saudi Mohamed Al-Deayyea.

     Saudi Arabia was simply the flop of the tournament, to the complete surprise 
of all the attending football experts and pundits...Gone are the days of Fouad 
Anwar Amin, Saeed Al-Owairan and Khaled Massa'ad Al-Muwallid (all of them halted 
from playing on the international scene by their national FA following the dreadful 
performances in the World Cup), and with only some rare talented players like 
striker Obaid Al-Dossari and midfielder Khaled Al-Timawi, it looks like "the 
Greens" will have an upheaval task to face in order to regain the great showings 
of the current decade's first half.

    Saying so, the German Otto Pfister (who was recalled once again to the side
following the sack of Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira) looked short of new 
ideas and positive imagination, added to  the current players' stunning 
unwillingness to provide the goods from him. With only 3 very narrow wins (2-1
over Kuwait, 1-0 over both Bahrain and UAE) and 2 draws (1-1 with Oman and 0-0
with lowly Qatar!), the side was rather extremely lucky to end the campaign at
the runners-up spot, one aspect emphasizing the low overall level of this year's 
competition.

    Without some brilliant displays by their vastly-experienced  keeper Al-Deayyea, 
the side was even on the verge of suffering some rather surprising defeats. For
the first time ever in the history of Saudi football, the written press media was 
surprisingly allowed even to attack their FA administrators, but also the players, 
for getting their national side in such a catastrophic mood, while hailed before 
the kick-off of the tournament as everyone's hot favourites to retain the coveted 
trophy from their neighbouring arch-rivals Kuwait. It must be wise to mention that 
the GULF CUP competition still bears too much in the thinking of the Saudi public, 
despite their national team's latest 2 outings in the World Cup finals, and to be 
humiliated in such a manner by Kuwait (particularly after winning the last ARAB
CUP) was something the Saudi opinion cannot even bear!

     The UAE case is really a puzzling one: while Kuwait has a weak league and
domestic competitions but still provide fine players, and Arabia having arguably 
the best league in the Arab world but only suffering currently from a shortage of 
good footballers at the international scene, the UAE (who only opened the domestic 
scene doors this current season to foreign players from overseas) is suffering
from both aspects: their local competitions are pretty poor, and the national 
side is lacking the abundance of fine players, with the retirement from the 
international scene of their most famous player, striker Adnan Al-Talyani, and
the suspension for further notice of vastly-experienced twin midfielders Bakhit
& Khamis Sa'ad from international duty. The 4-month period of new manager, the
Portuguese Carlos Manuel Queiroz never helped the Emirates' cause, as they 
finished at the third place, scoring only 5 goals in 5 matches and conceding 7.
It should be very interesting to see how the side will negociate the upcoming 
qualifiers of the 2000 Asian Cup (due to be held in October 2000 in the Lebanon), 
particularly as the FA President vowed he will keep faith with Mr. Queiroz 
during his 2-year contract, hoping he will gain the same success  recently 
enjoyed by his Czech counterpart, Mr. Milan Macala, at the hot seat of Kuwait's
managerial staff.
